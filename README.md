### Hi!

I'm Ross, a PhD Candidate at Stanford University in the Department of Communication where I'm also a Knight-Hennessy and Data Science Scholar.

I build computational tools to understand better how a dynamic media ecosystem effects people's offline beliefs and behaviors. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Misinformation exposure and effects
- Information exposure in encrypted messaging applications like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Signal
- Media system-level field experiments to study misinformation media effects

ðŸŒ± Technically, I'm learning more about:
- iOS & macOS development

ðŸ“š Substantively, I'm learning more about:
- History of the discipline of Communication
- Communication theory
