### Hi!

I'm Ross, a PhD Student at Stanford and recovering data scientist from the digital marketing industry. 

As a researcher in the Stanford Social Media Lab, I apply data science and computational techniques to better understand the connections between our online lives and offline behaviors. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- "[Identifying the Motivations of Political Donors with Social Media Data](https://github.com/rossdahlke/political_donor_motivations)"
- "[Political Donor Polarization: Observing Consumptive Behavior using a Network Approach](https://github.com/rossdahlke/donor_polarization)"

ðŸŒ± Technically, I'm learning more about:
- [CS 230: Deep Learning](https://cs230.stanford.edu/)

ðŸ“š Substantively, I'm studying:
- The theory and history of communication
- Communication research and pedagogy
