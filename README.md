### Hi!

I'm Ross, a[n incoming] PhD Student at Stanford and recovering data scientist from the digital marketing industry. 

I apply data science and computational techniques to better understand the connections between our online lives and offline behaviors. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- "[Identifying the Motivations of Political Donors with Social Media Data](https://github.com/rossdahlke/political_donor_motivations)"
- "[Political Donor Polarization in Wisconsin](https://github.com/rossdahlke/donor_polarization)"

ðŸŒ± Technically, I'm learning more about:
- [The Math Behind Deep Learning](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/)
- [Numerical Linear Algebra](https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra)

ðŸ“š Substantively, I'm studying:
- (Waiting for classes!)
